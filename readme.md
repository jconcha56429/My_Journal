My Journal is a passion project of mine for a virtual journal created by me intended to eventually be somewhere I can journal freely with user friendly UI. 

Some ideas I plan to implement in the future include:
- Day to day tracking with a likert raiting system of how the day went 
- Implemented ML to track sentiment based on the journal portion to guestimate how I would rate the day
- Sum the day in 3 words
- What I did today activities 
- The best & worst part of my day
- Locally hosted database system
